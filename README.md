# Employee Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee data to gain insights into workforce distribution, salary expenditure, and key trends. It involves data preprocessing, analysis tasks, and graphical representations to visualize patterns within the dataset.

## Preprocessing Steps
Before performing the analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency. One key preprocessing step was replacing incorrect "Height" values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to maintain data integrity. This step helped ensure the dataset was suitable for further analysis.

## Analysis Tasks
The project involved the following key analysis tasks:

1. **Employee Distribution by Team**
   - Counted the number of employees in each team.
   - Calculated the percentage of employees per team relative to the total workforce.
   - Visualized the distribution using a bar chart.

2. **Segregation of Employees by Position**
   - Counted the number of employees in each job position.
   - Represented the distribution through a bar chart.

3. **Predominant Age Group Analysis**
   - Defined age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64).
   - Categorized employees into these age groups.
   - Identified the age group with the highest number of employees.
   - Used a bar chart to display the distribution.

4. **Highest Salary Expenditure by Team and Position**
   - Aggregated salary data at both team and position levels.
   - Identified the team and position with the highest total salary expenditure.
   - Presented results using bar charts.

5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary**
   - Examined the relationship between an employee's age and salary.
   - Calculated the correlation coefficient.
   - Used a scatter plot to visualize the relationship.

## Graphical Representations
Each analysis task was accompanied by visualizations to enhance understanding:
- **Bar charts** for employee distribution by team and position.
- **Bar charts** for predominant age groups.
- **Bar charts** for salary expenditure by team and position.
- **Scatter plot** to investigate correlation between age and salary.

## Insights Gained
- Some teams have significantly higher numbers of employees compared to others.
- Certain job positions dominate the workforce.
- The majority of employees fall within the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups.
- Salary expenditure is concentrated in specific teams and positions.
- There is a measurable correlation between age and salary, providing insights into salary growth trends.

## Additional Information
- The dataset was loaded and analyzed using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** were used for graphical representation.
- All analysis steps were structured and optimized for efficiency.

## Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed employee data, providing valuable insights into workforce structure and salary allocation. The findings can assist HR and management in strategic decision-making regarding recruitment, compensation, and team structuring.
